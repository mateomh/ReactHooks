# How to use it

This is just an imformational repo, so each commit is dedicated to a functionality of one hook. Check the commit history to see all the topics covered

## Setup Locally

To run the application locally you will need to follow several steps to make it work.

First, you have to check if you have **nodejs** installed on your machine. For this type the following command in your terminal:

> node -v

If **command not found** shows as a response, then go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the instructions to install it. After completing the installation the same command should show you a version number.

Then clone the [repository](https://github.com/mateomh/TasklistTypescript.git) into your local drive and open a terminal in the root folder of the project and install the necessary packages to make it work by running this command:

> npm install

This will get the project ready to run. After this run the following command to start the development server on **localhost:3000/** and wait for the browser to open:

> npm start

If the browser does not open or you close it by accident, but the server is still running you can type **localhost:3000/** in your address bar to get into the application again.
